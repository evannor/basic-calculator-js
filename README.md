Hello!

Thanks for checking out my Basic Calculator project!

Currently, this calculator can perform basic mathematics calculations following PEMDAS logic. PEMDAS is an acronym for the sequence of operations one is required to follow when seeking the answer to mathematical equations. There is even an output on the screen which shows the current calculation being completed.

In this current version, the user can execute basic equations. Although the Calculator has the option to include parantheses in the equation, the logic to execute an equation which includes them is still being implemented. If a user attempts to add paranthese, the user will be alerted with an error message.
